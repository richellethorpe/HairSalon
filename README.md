## Setup/Installation Requirements

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "OrderTracker". 
3. Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS.
